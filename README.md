This project, titled "Music Streaming system", is a legitimate work carried out by the aforementioned students under the supervision of Prof. Archana N. Vyas for the Database Management System subject during the academic year 2021-2022.

## Commendation

We're deeply grateful to everyone involved in the successful completion of our project "Hertz". Our heartfelt thanks go out to Prof. Archana N. Vyas for her invaluable guidance and assistance.

## System Overview

### 1.1 Current System
Our database is structured similarly to Spotify's, prioritizing data organization for features such as user playlists and future recommendation systems. We've emphasized the establishment of a 'collaboration' and 'following' feature in our database to promote user interaction.

### 1.2 Objectives of the Proposed System
Music consumption has drastically shifted over the years. From tangible purchases to digital streaming services, our project aims to enhance the digital music experience by offering tailored recommendations, a social network for users, and a flexible platform for on-the-go listening.

### 1.3 Advantages of the Proposed System
- **Personalized Playlists**: Hertz allows users to curate and enjoy custom playlists, including those crafted by our in-house developers.
- **Podcast Evolution**: Hertz aims to elevate the podcast experience while providing a seamless platform for artists to record and distribute content.
- **Optimized Database**: The Hertz database is highly normalized, ensuring efficient data retrieval and minimized redundancy.
